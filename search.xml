Market participants have adopted the convention that a rally refers to falling interest rates, while a sell off refers to rising rates. principal v.s. notional principal: pricipal is the real money your pay.e.g. you pay 0 for a 100 swap There are a lot of conventions, do not discuss them, just follow them LIBORICE LIBOR “At what rate could you borrow funds, were you to do so by asking for and then accepting interbank offers in a reasonable market size just prior to 11 am?” FRAsFRAs are OTC transactions. In a FRA transaction, counterparty A agrees to pay counterparty B LIBOR settling t years from now applied to a specified notional amount (say, $100 mm). In exchange, counterparty B pays counterparty A a pre-agreed interest rate (say, 3:05%) applied to the same notional. Because of their granular structure, they allow one to hedge the exposure or express the view on rates move on specific days.e.g. an FOMC FRA is a FRA which fixes the day after a Federal Open Markets Committee meeting. a turn switch allows to hedge or express the view on the rate spikes idiosyncratic to the month-, quarter- or year-end.
